Here‚Äôs a **complete logical flow** of your factory management system, showing how **BOM, UOM, GRN, Inventory, Job Work, and Production** are **connected** across forms and logic:

---

## üîÅ **Logical Flow Overview**

```
[UOM] ‚Üí [Inventory] ‚Üî [BOM] ‚Üí [Job Work] ‚Üí [GRN] ‚Üí [Inventory Update] ‚Üí [Production]
```

---

### üîπ 1. **UOM (Unit of Measurement)**

* Base unit conversion logic (e.g. 1 Kg = 1000 gm = 100 pcs).
* Used globally across:

  * Inventory (stock tracking in pieces, kg, box, etc.)
  * Purchase Orders (buying in KG, updating inventory in pcs)
  * BOM and GRN (conversion & calculations)
* Ensures consistency and automatic unit conversions.

---

### üîπ 2. **Inventory**

* Central source of truth for all materials and products.
* Fields: `qty_raw`, `qty_wip`, `qty_finished`, `qty_scrap`.
* Integrated with:

  * PO (adds stock)
  * BOM (validates availability)
  * Job Work (deducts stock)
  * GRN (adds finished goods/scrap)
  * Production (deducts inputs, adds final product)

---

### üîπ 3. **BOM (Bill of Materials)**

* Blueprint of how many materials are required for each product.
* Includes:

  * Input material(s)
  * Output quantity
  * Optional scrap factor, wastage, conversion
* Used in:

  * Production: To validate available stock before creating production orders
  * Job Work: To allocate input materials from inventory

---

### üîπ 4. **Job Work**

* Takes materials from inventory and sends them for **In-House or Outsourced Processing**.
* Multi-process flows (Cutting ‚Üí Zinc ‚Üí Assembly).
* Deducts from `qty_raw`, moves to `qty_wip`.
* BOM defines how many sheets are needed per output.
* Can be used recursively for nested assemblies.

---

### üîπ 5. **GRN (Goods Receipt Note)**

* Material return point:

  * From Job Work
  * From Purchase
* What happens:

  * `qty_wip` ‚Üí `qty_finished`
  * Scrap calculated (based on GRN data)
  * Triggers inspection if configured
* Automatically updates job work status:

  * `sent` ‚Üí `partial_received` ‚Üí `completed`

---

### üîπ 6. **Production**

* Final transformation phase:

  * Uses finished items (e.g., mounted plate + base plate) from inventory
  * Checks stock via BOM
  * Deducts input inventory
  * Adds final product to `qty_finished`
* Handles internal processes like Assembly, Packing, etc.

## üß† **Example Scenario**

Let‚Äôs say you are producing **100 Castor Wheels**:

1. **BOM**:

   * 1 wheel = 1 mounted plate + 1 base plate + 1 nut/bolt
   * BOM is created.

2. **Inventory Check**:

   * System checks if materials are available.

3. **Job Work**:

   * 5 sheets sent for cutting (Job Work)
   * BOM says 1 sheet ‚Üí 400 mounted plates

4. **GRN**:

   * 2000 mounted plates received
   * 50 scrap recorded
   * Inventory updated: mounted\_plate ‚Üí `qty_finished += 2000`

5. **Production**:

   * Using 100 mounted + 100 base plates ‚Üí Create 100 wheels
   * Inventory: mounted\_plate `-100`, base\_plate `-100`
   * Inventory: castor\_wheel `+100`

| Module     | Feeds          | Feeds Into                |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| UOM        | ALL            | Inventory, BOM, GRN       |
| Inventory  | PO, GRN        | BOM, Job Work, Production |
| BOM        | Admin Input    | Job Work, Production      |
| Job Work   | Inventory, BOM | GRN                       |
| GRN        | Job Work       | Inventory                 |
| Production | Inventory, BOM | Inventory                 |
