To implement this partial GRN and accounting voucher system in your app, follow this step-by-step plan. It connects **Purchase Orders → GRNs → Invoices → Payments**, while auto-updating inventory and accounts.

## ✅ 1. Database Design (Relational Mapping)

### 🗂️ Key Tables

| Table Name        | Purpose                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `purchase_orders` | Store PO master data                  |
| `po_items`        | Line items (product, qty, rate)       |
| `grns`            | Each GRN record (partial/full)        |
| `grn_items`       | Items received in each GRN            |
| `vouchers`        | Accounting vouchers (type-based)      |
| `voucher_entries` | Voucher lines (ledger, dr/cr, amount) |
| `inventory`       | Tracks material stock with batch info |

## ✅ 2. GRN Workflow Logic

### 🔁 When GRN is Created:

1. Validate PO reference and remaining quantity.
2. Allow user to input **actual qty received**, rate (optional), tax, freight.
3. Auto-calculate value = qty × rate.
4. Save entry to `grns` and `grn_items`.
5. Generate a **Purchase Voucher**:

   * Dr Inventory
   * Cr GRN Clearing Account

## ✅ 3. Invoice Workflow Logic

### 🧾 When Vendor Invoice is Uploaded:

1. Link to existing GRN.
2. Input GST, freight, etc.
3. Create **Invoice Voucher**:

   * Dr GRN Clearing A/c
   * Dr GST Input
   * Cr Vendor Account

> You can also create auto-matching if invoice quantity ≠ GRN quantity (alert user).

## ✅ 4. Payment Workflow

### 💰 When Payment is Made:

1. Link to Vendor Account from Invoice.
2. Record mode: Bank, Cash, UPI, etc.
3. Generate **Payment Voucher**:

   * Dr Vendor
   * Cr Bank/Cash

## ✅ 5. Auto Update PO Status

* On each GRN:

  * Update total received quantity
  * Show balance qty remaining
* On Invoice:

  * Track pending payments
* On Payment:

  * Clear Vendor dues

## ✅ 6. Reporting and Dashboards

| Report                     | Description                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| PO Fulfillment Report      | Shows total vs received         |
| Vendor Outstanding Summary | Vendor-wise unpaid balances     |
| Inventory Inward Report    | Shows material received by GRNs |
| Journal Register           | List of all generated vouchers  |
| GST Input Summary          | Monthly tax received report     |

## 🧠 UI Logic (Form Behavior)

* **PO View** → \[“Create GRN”] → opens modal prefilled from PO
* **GRN View** → \[“Create Invoice”] → opens invoice form
* **Invoice View** → \[“Record Payment”] → prefilled payment screen
