Great — let’s now design your **enhanced BOM (Bill of Materials)** module with **all real-world features**, including:

---

## ✅ **Core BOM Objectives**

Your BOM should now handle:

* Multi-level component relationships (nested BOM)
* Unit cost calculations (RM + Labor + Machine)
* Batch tracking
* Inventory linking
* Accounting impact
* Process stages for job work or in-house steps

## 🧩 **1. BOM Structure Design**

### 🎯 **BOM Header**

| Field           | Purpose                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| BOM Code        | Unique ID like `BOM-001`            |
| Product Name    | Final product (e.g. "Castor Wheel") |
| Version         | BOM versioning                      |
| Effective Date  | Start date of BOM validity          |
| Output Quantity | Final quantity (e.g. 1 wheel)       |

---

### 🧱 **2. BOM Components Table**

| Item Type | Item Name      | Quantity | UOM | Source     | Cost/Unit | Total Cost |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- | --- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| RM        | MS Sheet       | 1.5      | kg  | Inventory  | ₹50       | ₹75        |
| RM        | Nut & Bolt     | 1        | pcs | Inventory  | ₹10       | ₹10        |
| Process   | Cutting        | -        | -   | Job Work   | ₹5        | ₹5         |
| Process   | Zincing        | -        | -   | Vendor B   | ₹4        | ₹4         |
| Machine   | Press Machine  | 1        | Hr  | In-house   | ₹10/hr    | ₹10        |
| Labour    | Assembler Wage | 0.5      | Hr  | Department | ₹30/hr    | ₹15        |

**→ Auto-calculated Total Cost: ₹119 per unit**

✅ You can also support **Phantom BOMs**: group components used in multiple final products.

### 🔁 **3. Process Routing Section (If Needed)**

| Step No. | Stage    | Performed By | Inputs     | Output     | Machine     | Time Est. |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 1        | Cutting  | Vendor A     | MS Sheet   | Cut Plate  | -           | 30 mins   |
| 2        | Zincing  | Vendor B     | Cut Plate  | Zinc Plate | -           | 1 hour    |
| 3        | Assembly | In-house     | Zinc Plate | Castor     | Press Mach. | 45 mins   |

✅ Supports job work cost integration.

---

### ⚙️ **4. Machine and Labor Settings (Optional Controls)**

* \[✔] Use Machine Rate for Costing
* \[✔] Use Labor Rate
* Rate Master Configuration Section:

| Entity     | Rate Type | UOM  | Rate    |
| ---------- | --------- | ---- | ------- |
| Press Mach | Hourly    | Hr   | ₹10/hr  |
| Operator A | Piece     | Unit | ₹3/unit |

---

## 🔄 **5. Inventory & Accounting Integration**

* 💡 RM auto-reserved from Inventory
* 📥 BOM cost used in GRN / Finished Good valuation
* 💰 Labor/Machine → WIP ledger (Cost of Production)
* 🔁 Changes in BOM reflect in per-unit **Cost Sheet**
* 📊 Sync with Accounting for COGS and job costing

---

## 🧠 AI-Driven Suggestions (Optional)

* Auto-calculate **optimum cut plans**
* Alert if BOM cost > last sale price (profit risk)
* Suggest **alternate RM** based on availability

## 📋 BOM Form Layout – Tabs

```
[BOM Info] [Components] [Process Routing] [Machine & Labor] [Cost Sheet Preview] [Accounting Linkage]
```

## 📷 Want to See the Visual Form?

I've already generated a UI mockup earlier with:

* Input table
* Job stages
* Machine & Labor toggle
* Cost calculation

Let me know if you'd like to **turn that into an HTML or Flask Jinja2 form**.

Would you also like:

* ✅ A sample nested BOM example (parent-child)?
* ✅ Python/Flask model + form design?
* ✅ AI-powered BOM optimization logic?

Let me know and I’ll generate it for you.
