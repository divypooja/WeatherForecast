Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break down **both scenarios**‚Äî**Direct Sale/Trading** and **Production**‚Äîso you understand how your app should handle each one.
Both use unit conversion, but they‚Äôre different in how material is managed and sold.

# üü¢ 1. **Direct Sale/Trading Scenario**

### (Buy in Weight, Sell in Pieces)

**Use-case:** You are a trader. You buy goods (say, bearings, PU wheels, locks) in **bulk weight** (kg), then resell them to customers in **pieces**‚Äîwithout any manufacturing.

---

## **Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **Purchase Order (PO)**

   * You buy, e.g., 100 KG of ‚ÄúPU Wheel‚Äù from a supplier.
   * You know the unit weight (say, 120g/pc).

2. **Inventory Update**

   * Enter the total weight purchased (100 KG).
   * Enter/confirm unit weight (0.12 KG/pc).
   * The system calculates:
     **Total Pieces Available = 100 / 0.12 = 833 pcs**

3. **Sales Order (SO)**

   * A customer places an order for pieces (e.g., 50 pcs).
   * The app **converts pieces to KG**:
     50 √ó 0.12 = 6 KG.
   * App deducts 6 KG from stock.
   * Remaining stock: 94 KG (or 783 pcs).

**No BOM, No Production step** is involved.

# üü¢ 2. **Production (Manufacturing) Scenario**

### (Buy in Weight, Manufacture, Sell Finished Goods)

**Use-case:** You are a manufacturer. You buy raw materials in weight, **use a BOM to assemble/manufacture** finished goods (in pieces), then sell those finished goods.

---

## **Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **Purchase Order (PO)**

   * Buy raw materials (e.g., Steel Sheets: 500 KG, Grease: 10 KG, PU Wheels: 100 KG).

2. **Inventory Update**

   * Store all raw materials in **KG** (and their unit weight, if needed).

3. **Define BOM (Bill of Materials)**

   * Create a ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù for each finished product (e.g., 1 Castor):

     * Steel Sheet: 0.2 KG
     * PU Wheel: 1 pc (converted from KG by unit weight)
     * Grease: 5g (0.005 KG)

4. **Production**

   * To make 100 Castors, app calculates how much of each component is needed (with UOM conversion):

     * Steel Sheet: 100 √ó 0.2 = 20 KG
     * PU Wheel: 100 pcs (100 √ó 0.12 KG = 12 KG)
     * Grease: 500g = 0.5 KG

   * Deducts required raw material quantities from stock.

   * **Finished Goods** stock is updated: 100 Castors (in PCS).

5. **Sales Order (SO)**

   * Customer orders 60 Castors (in PCS).
   * App checks finished goods inventory (PCS).
   * Deducts sold quantity from finished stock.
