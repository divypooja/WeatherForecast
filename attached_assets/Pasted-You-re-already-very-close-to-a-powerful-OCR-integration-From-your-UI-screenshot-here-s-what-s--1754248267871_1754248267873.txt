You're already **very close** to a powerful OCR integration! From your UI screenshot, here’s what’s happening — and what we can do to **boost OCR accuracy and reliability**.

---

## ✅ What's Working

* ✅ OCR engine is running successfully
* ✅ PDF is being read and data is extracted
* ✅ You have a **preview + apply to form** system
* ✅ Confidence score is being shown (good UX)

---

## ❌ What's Not Perfect

* ❌ Extracted fields like `"Invoice: FROM"` are incomplete
* ❌ Accuracy is below 80% — too risky for accounting use
* ❌ Some business logic fields (vendor name, invoice number) may not be structured well in the source file

## 🔧 How to Improve OCR Accuracy (Especially for Tesseract / PaddleOCR)

### 🧹 1. **Preprocess the Document**

Use OpenCV to clean the image/PDF before OCR:

```python
import cv2

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, 0)
    img = cv2.resize(img, None, fx=1.5, fy=1.5)
    img = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (5,5), 0)
    _, img = cv2.threshold(img, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
    return img
```

Apply this before passing it to Tesseract or PaddleOCR.

### 🧠 2. **Use Layout-Aware OCR (Like LayoutParser or PaddleOCR layout)**

Extract fields like:

* 🧾 Invoice No
* 🏢 Vendor
* 📅 Date
* 💰 Amount
* 🔢 GSTIN

With bounding boxes. Use layout-aware models:

```bash
pip install layoutparser
```

---

### 🔍 3. **Field-Specific Extraction with Regex + AI**

Post-processing is key:

```python
import re

def extract_invoice_number(text):
    match = re.search(r'(INV[- ]?\d{3,})', text)
    return match.group(0) if match else ''
```

Add regex for GSTIN, date, amount, etc.

### 🧠 4. **Ensemble OCR Engines (Tesseract + PaddleOCR + EasyOCR)**

Run multiple engines in background and choose:

* Highest confidence
* Cross-agreed values

This can increase accuracy by **10–20%** in real-world docs.

---

### 🧪 5. **Feedback Learning Loop**

Let user correct fields → Save those corrections → Use in future via:

* N-gram pattern matching
* AI correction engine (fine-tuned with examples)

## 🧭 Suggested System Settings

| Setting                    | Recommended Value           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| DPI                        | ≥ 300 for scanned docs      |
| Tesseract psm mode         | `--psm 6` or `--psm 11`     |
| Image contrast enhancement | Yes                         |
| LayoutParser Model         | `PubLayNet` or `Detectron2` |
| PaddleOCR                  | `PP-OCRv3 + layout`         |

### ✅ Conclusion

You can **dramatically improve OCR results** by combining:

* Preprocessing + Layout detection
* Field post-processing (regex)
* Multi-engine (Tesseract + PaddleOCR fallback)
* Confidence filtering + user override
